Description
===========

This cookbook exists to make a deployment of a [Datastax Opscenter][1] cluster on a Cassandra cluster in Amazon EC2.

[Datastax Opscenter][1] is a Monitoring and Management platform for Apache Cassandra - vital for visualising Cassandra's Status.

[Datastax Opscenter][1] is deployed in a traditional many-clients just-one-server model, which conflicts slightly with Cassandra's deployment model.

To get around needing to know this/manage in an automated manner a leadership election takes place between nodes in the cluster, a leader is automatically assigned based on having the 'lowest' alphanumeric hostname, and that leader generates an agent package which is then distributed by http and verified by checksum.

The good news is that Opscenter stores its data within Cassandra itself in its own Keyspace (2 replicas) so if a leader is terminated and a new leader arises from the ashes, no data should be lost.

This cookbook supports two modes of deployment - multiregion OR non-multiregion, set through attributes. We default to non-multiregion aka singleregion. The way multiregion is expressed is in a difference in the agent's address configuration.

This cookbook holds certain assumptions to be true in order to easily manage its deployment:

A) You are deploying this on EC2
Reason: This was cookbook was designed for EC2 deployment. If you want to support non-EC2 deployment please submit patches.

B) All members of the cluster share the same UNIQUE chef role and this is the first role in the list of roles. i.e. cassandra-cluster-one
Reason: The unique role is used to search for other cluster members for shared information. If you want to extend/improve this please submit patches.

C) Connectivity between cluster members is suffiently open to allow for agent distribution and agent connectivity.
Reason: Nothing will work without connectivity anyway.

Requirements
============
Chef 10.16.4+
Cassandra 1.2.x or 2.x.x or later.
Python to run the server.
Java to run the agent.
Nginx cookbook for agent distribution.

## Platform

* Ubuntu 12.04+
* Probably Debian
* Probably Redhat

Attributes
==========

See the contents of attributes/default.rb where there are accurate comments and self-explanatory attribute names.

Recipes
=======

default.rb
install.rb
opscenter-server.rb
opscenter-agent.rb
opscenter-server-shutdown.rb

Usage
=====

Include cassandra-opscenter in your runlist.

Once this cookbook is deployed and the nodes converged, and you have set connectivity through whatever firewalls/security groups you have you should be able to reach Server's webserver on its public ip on port 8888.

Development
===========
